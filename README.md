Troll items:
- Rift Expeller:

     (also creates a copy of it in the final battle)
Space travel:
- Sub-Light: standard space travel, not much here, standard drive (early game)
- Lightspeed: almost speed of light, really fast, but time dilation effects.... mid tier, standard/lightspeed drive (early midgame)
- Hyperspeed: drive brings you into hyperspace, where there is no speed limit, and movement is 100x, needs a hyperspace drive and a standard drive, (midgame)
- Jumpspeed: a tiny wormhole in hyperspace, moves extremly fast, basically instant, needs a hyperspace drive, standard drive, and a tunnel generator (orbital station, late-game) or a jump drive (ship system, extremely late game)
Galaxy Gen:
Starting System connects to clusters, which are made up of multiple systems connected closely. Clusters Connect to each other and lonely systems.
Semi-Procedural, clusters, systems, planets, and moons are defined but have the abiltiy for randomness
World surface is random but uses that world's stats to guide generation
all generation is procedural, galaxy seed and size is all that is needed to gen galaxy, surfaces have their own seed and are tied to a planet/moon
Also will be asteroid clouds, and ejected planets
