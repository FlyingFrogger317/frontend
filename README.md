Troll items:
- Rift Expeller (weapon):
     When fired at a ship, it causes it to phase out of reality (to the final battle :))
     If at final battle, it instead duplicates that ship exactly (same damage, weapon condition, etc.)

Space travel:
- Sub-Light: standard space travel, not much here, standard drive (early game)
- Lightspeed: almost speed of light, really fast, but time dilation effects.... mid tier, standard/lightspeed drive (early midgame)
- Hyperspeed: drive brings you into hyperspace, where there is no speed limit, and movement is 100x, needs a hyperspace drive and a standard drive, (midgame)
- Jumpspeed: a tiny wormhole in hyperspace, moves extremly fast, basically instant, needs a hyperspace drive, standard drive, and a tunnel generator (orbital station, late-game) or a jump drive (ship system, extremely late game)

Galaxy Gen:
- Starting System connects to clusters, which are made up of multiple systems connected closely. Clusters Connect to each other and lonely systems.
- Semi-Procedural, clusters, systems, planets, and moons are defined but have the abiltiy for randomness
- World surface is random but uses that world's stats to guide generation
- all generation is procedural, galaxy seed and size is all that is needed to gen galaxy, surfaces have their own seed and are tied to a planet/moon
- Also will be asteroid clouds, and ejected planets

Gameplay:
- 3 (4?) "modes":
  - On Surface
  - In space
  - Space combat
  - Ground combat?
- On surface you build a factory, create ships and stuff
- In space you fly around to get to new planetary bodies

COMBAT:
You control your fleet (similar to MOO2), but ships have inertia and stuff
Weapon types:
- Laser: Beam weaponry, high armor damage, medium shield damage, but is incapable of pierce, has poor structure damage, and fire control is based on heat generated by firing
- Ballistic: Like a railgun or a cannon, has good shield damage, high armor and structure damage, but low armor and shield pierce, requires ammo, and has a low fire rate
- Plasma: like laser cannons and stuff, average in all respects
- Missile: Self explanitory, high damage to armor and structure, and decent armor pierce, with excellent shield pierce, but requires ammo, and does no shield damage
Shield types:
- Sectional Absorbtion: only covers an area, absorbs damage, and can be pierced, high regen and medium hp
- Encirclement Absorbsion: covers full ship, absorbs damage, and can be pierced, high regen and medium hp
- Sectional Barrier: only covers an area, absorbs damage, and cannot be pierced, requires an absorption shield in that area, 2x disabled regen bonus, very high hp but low regen
- Encirclement Barrier: covers full ship, absorbs damage, and cannot be pierced, requires an absorption shield, 2x disabled regen bonus, very high hp but low regen
If a shield loses its hp, it pops and takes 50% system damage
Popped shields take two turns to restart and can only be reenabled after its hp gets to 25% full
Disabled shields get a 2x regen bonus until reenabled
Calculations:
- Shield piercing: $\min\left(1, \frac{\min(SD, SI)}{SI} \times PC\right)$
